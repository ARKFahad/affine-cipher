Affine Cipher
An affine cipher is a type of symmetric-key block cipher, and it can be described as follows:
Affine cipher is a method of encrypting data that uses an integer transformation to encode plaintext characters into ciphertext. It is known for its simplicity and ease of implementation.
The formula used in an affine cipher is:
[E(x) = (a*x + b) mod m]
where:

E is the ciphertext character
a is an integer value between 0 and n-1
x is the plaintext character
b is an integer value between 0 and n-2
m is the number of unique characters in the alphabet (usually 26 for English)

When encrypting, the formula can be modified to:
[E(x) = (a \cdot x + b) \mod m]
where a and b are determined by a key which is shared among users.
For decryption, the following formula would be used:
[E(x) = (a*x + b') mod m]
where a' and b' are related with a and b.
